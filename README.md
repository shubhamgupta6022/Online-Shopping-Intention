Streamlit Web App to predict the revenue for the users on their search history.

## Data
The data for the following example is originally from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/). The data contains information on females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions. The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.

## Pre-requisites
Installation with pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started
Open the terminal in you machine and run the following command to access the web application in your localhost.
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
